Say a bit earlier what we actually did.

How did we implement “lean”/“agile” methodology?

Say more about each project - use Sarah’s slides

For summary: “you could do this at home!” What are the *necessary* ingredients for success? Stakeholder engagement (two days a week! No projects “thrown over the wall“). Project management. In-house data scientists

Questions: long-term impact?

Mention huge interest (students, projects) - social good and urban a good focus (for us, and in general)


##################
X Pie-chart legends
X Legends on figures in project panels

X Pie-chart about their programming experience prior to the DSSG.

X Shorten the "project" text => 4-5 sentences each.
Social sciences => further breakdown!

X Scientific communication: WHAT??

X More about speakers and discussion group

X stake-holder => stakeholder

X Break down further the challenges and lessons. Data scientists important assert - WHY? Stakeholder involvement important - HOW? Etc.

X Stakeholders: understanding the nature of the data (context, but other things as well).  Focusing the projects  - having clear sense of success/failure and purpose

X Data scientists fulfilled a variety of different roles: management, specific techincal advice, mentorship, coordination. Shared work-space really helpful!

X Dedicated program managers essential! Community building and coordination at a higher than team level lends cohesiveness (and logistics is a bear!)

X Add to lessons: this can be done at different scales!

X Well-defined projects are important.

### TALK ####


In every project - what was the larger goal? what was the data? What was *one* key result (in social good terms!)?

"Succesful exists IN BLUE" (!!)

Incubator projects: what are these images?

From the context - interim summary - before "our recipe"

Our recipe - mention project managers there ?

Another interim summary after the projects

"As you can see, the projects were rather diverse in terms of scope, challenges and questions. You can appreciate that there is potential for these solutions to have impact... A few over-arching lessons we learned <click>"

For the lessons learned slide:

- Tone down the impact point!

- Add a bullet point about the flexible scaling of this program!

- Trainee diversity is a strength - quick example: for example big picture vs. details.

- Diversity means: levels of technical expertise, specific knowledge, disciplinary experience, personal experience.
